# The Boxer

![](https://i.imgur.com/G8qPDTT.png)

Born in the cramped and unforgiving quarters of a mining asteroid under Tharsis Mining's dominion, The Boxer was christened with a name he would soon outgrow. The corridors and mining shafts of his youth did little to contain his spirit or his physique, which burgeoned beyond the confines of his origins into that of a formidable force. 

His earnest idiocy in matters of the heart made him **a fool in love and lust**, often compromising his professional relationships and missions. Despite his rugged exterior and formidable presence, his interactions with women revealed **a man struggling to navigate the complexities of intimacy and affection**, repeatedly ensnared by his desires and prejudices.

Yet, beneath this tumultuous surface, lay a singular, burning desire: to **escape the life of a mercenary and the endless cycle of violence and remorse**. The Boxer **dreams of a simpler existence**, one far removed from the cold metal corridors of mining asteroids and the vacuous expanse of space. He imagines a life as a **farmer**, tilling soil and nurturing life, a stark contrast to the destruction and chaos that have so far defined his existence.
