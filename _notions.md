- [ ] Lomax also mentions that another [tharsisMining](../factions/tharsisMining.md) ship (the Ore Voyager) recently refuelled in Brigthside, and the crew updates him that they also work for Tharsis. '*Why is Tharsis Mining involved in finding alien artefacts?*'. This can come to rescue the PCs if the nuclear reactor is destroyed. The ship will be carrying Ice, which might infect everyone in the station.
