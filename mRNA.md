> Core Worlds, 2225 AD {-}

## Prelude

Advanced alien ruins were found in 2225 in the [Perdurabo](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/system/PWrHAjd6P64k61Ga1PfQ) system. An ice sample was bought by Tharsis' Parkfield Biolabs, which contained RNA that can be used to cure early dementia caused by frequent faster than light travel. The RNA named Neuroplasticity Augmentor Sequence (NAS-RNA), however, the RNA cannot be easily replicated in laboratory. For this reason, the discovery was not made public yet, and Tharsis has been moving fast to evaluate the feasibility to establish an ice mine in the system.

If proven feasible, the existence of the [Brightside Mining Station](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/spaceStation/8LCcs3wrwRYwyUx5P0OL) in the system is an advantage. The station is a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play (see Hostile-Setting 82, for detail on the licensing process).

Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station's steel skin.

### Contract

**Contract signed with [Tharsis Mining](factions/tharsisMining.md) Supervisor for Ice Exploration [John McLeod](npcs/JohnMcLeod.md).**

You are the crew going to Perdurabo. You main goal is to execute the Exploration Framework that enables the commercial evaluation of the Ice Mine play. Non-disclosed milestones, that will be paid off books, is infiltrating and deteriorating the leadership of [Brightside Mining Station](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/spaceStation/8LCcs3wrwRYwyUx5P0OL), so its later acquisition is even cheaper. 

Contracted roles and milestones are detailed below. Monthly salary is Salary + Multiplier x Profession Rank. Each milestone pays a bonus of a number of times the crew monthly salary. The crew will have a LTDA company where they are the shareholders.

Basic ship maintenance & fuel is paid by shipowner, additional repairs & fuels are paid by the LTDA (discounted for contract payment).

Ship must dock for life support supplies every 6 weeks (max life support is 2 months). Work shifts are 12x12, 7 days a week. You will carry a holographic AI suitcase to speak with the GM weekly on Saturdays. Replacements (in case of sickness or indisposition) will be sent from the fastest system where they can be available.

### Perdurabo

![](https://i.imgur.com/RLOfasI.png)

On the evening before the mission kick-off meeting with [Tharsis Mining](factions/tharsisMining.md) Manager for Ice Exploration [John McLeod](npcs/JohnMcLeod.md), the crew find a scientist from [Haruna](../factions/haruna.md) tied to a bomb in the toilets of a bar in French Guiana. They learn of the animosity of the [Lebkuchen](factions/lebkuchen.md) activists against Haruna's cloning endeavours. After all that is sorted, they decide to bet on Olaf in a boxing ring, which proves to be successful.

On the next day they finally meet with John McLeod, and preparations for the travel to Perdurabo start.
