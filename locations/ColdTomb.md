Guardian drones are autonomous guard robots that the Chittik employed in places that required no sophisticated monitoring. The guardians are well-equipped for the execution of any non- Chittik that violate the area. Guardian drones do not have true AI, but they can carry out direct, simple instructions from any living Chittik.

The drones appear to be man-sized constructs of glossy black plating and sharp edges, beetle-like and resembling a Chittik in shape. They have three pairs of legs- one for locomotion, one for manipulation, and one equipped with brutal claws.
