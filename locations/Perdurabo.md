Red giant star.

Hard Light is dominated by its primary, a late-stage red giant known locally as Perdurabo, or “The Beast”. Most of the system interior has already been consumed by the star’s expansion, leaving it with a thick penumbra of rocky debris. There are no habitable worlds in the system. The only registered settlement is the [Brightside](BrightsideStation.md) mining station, with approximately one hundred inhabitants and basic facilities for ship refueling and repair.

Some asteroids are known to house alien tombs, such as the [Cold Tomb](ColdTomb.md).
