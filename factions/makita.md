# Makita Genetics Solomons

A market leader in genetics and the creator of Retrogenics, the science of retroactively splicing and force-growing animal or engineered DNA into a host. Retrogenics technology is experimental and not licensed for use on humans. The chairman of Makita is the mysterious Taneo Tomita, a virtual recluse in the Tokyo Sky Tower that serves as the corporation’s global headquarters. The corporation spends a great deal on its public image and the corp is seen as the first of a new kind of company that could change the world and the destiny of the human race purely through genetics. The company has incorporated several medical companies including Alcor, the 1970s cryogenics firm. Makita made the cryonics breakthrough that now allows full-body freezing (or ‘stasis’) using the now ubiquitous hypersleep chamber. Makita’s rival is [Haruna Biolabs](haruna.md).

Makita Genetics, the conglomerate’s successful genetics corporation, has been supplying the United States military with bioweapon prototypes for the past five years. These bioweapons are an attempt by the American superpower to ‘equalize’ the Tau Ceti war and strike at invisible and undetectable enemy infiltrators. The dye-markers, bioluminescent algae and genetically-tailored viruses have so far been ineffectual, but the Pentagon is convinced that victory might just lay with some type of weaponized biology – and not bombs. Should the corporation succeed then the unrestricted corporate development license for Tau Ceti has been promised to Wu-Ketai!
