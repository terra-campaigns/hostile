Transdyne Cybersystems (TDC) â€“ A dedicated robotic manufacturing corporation, TDC builds all kinds of cybersystems, for every possible task. The software division is exemplary and also jealous. It has been known for TDC to release icebreaker software on shareware bulletins in the hope that some desperate cowboy hacker will use it; these programs are often booby-trapped and allow the target corp to trace the perpetrator straight away. TDC has also made radical developments in Artificial Intelligence and uses AI technology in many robotic and software applications. Fully aware androids are now on the production line and very popular with high-end security firms, space agencies, SWAT teams, seabed exploration companies and rescue services. The life-like qualities of this fourth generation of human robots are staggering, and many people can be easily fooled by the Transdyne products. Just as with the earlier generations of human robots, modern androids are extremely complex, sophisticated and expensive. The tasks they are given are typically extraordinarily difficult, dangerous or exacting. Biggest cyborg sellers are the multi-tasking technician model the Transdyne Cybersystems 70 (selling for around $800,000, equivalent to the cost of a military armoured vehicle) and the combat model Transdyne Cybersystems 110 (selling for around $2 million, roughly equivalent to the cost of an armoured tank).
