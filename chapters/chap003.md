## Defiance and back

> {{ page.timestamp }}, {{ page.sector}}

- The [Doomborgs](../Doomborgs.md) crew travel to the neighbour system: the Teegarden's Star. During the spike drill, [Bennet](../pcs/Oliver.md) used the time to execute a biopsy on one of the crab creatures that infested the starship previously. The doctor was very unlucky when a splash of acid hits his eyes, blinding him.
- Upon arriving on Teegarden's Star, the captain makes contact with the system control and gets redirected to the [Tharsis Mining](../factions/tharsisMining.md) office on the [Defiance](../locations/Defiance.md). A shuttle picks the crew from orbit and a truck and a car takes them and the corpse to the corporation estate.
- The Doomborgs meet [Lucas Maluf](../npcs/LucasMaluf.md), a rough operations coordinator in the system, who explains next steps: they are to complete the mining contract as fast as possible, avoiding any further information leak. [The Boxer](../npcs/TheBoxer.md) crew, a group of mercenaries, will be responsible for collecting the remaining corpses and taking them to Earth.
- While the meeting goes on, Bennet is in the hospital, and learns his eyes are doomed. He will need a cybernetic implant, and that can be arranged within a week.
- The crew meets again, and decide that waiting a week would be too long. [Sabaka](../pcs/Sabaka.md) connects on the dark web and finds a fixer that can help them get a second hand cybereyes set within a day. The Doomborgs agree with the fixer and go to the appointed location, a district nightclub.
- In the nightclub they meet an energetic girl, who are to guide them getting the second hand cybereyes - from someone wearing it! They get into a VIP booth, where the target is having fun with what looks like a prostitute. The crew is swift and put the target on the floor, while the girl they just met "pops off" his eyes.
- The group successfully drive to a shady cybernetic clinic where Bennet has his new eyes implanted. They are ready to continue their mining contract now, and travel back to [Perdurabo](../locations/Perdurabo.md).
- In the [Cold Tomb](../locations/ColdTomb.md), they find the Leadbelly docked to the tomb, while The Boxer's ship - the Brutomaker - is docked to the second airlock of the Leadbelly. [Oni](../pcs/Oni.md) docks the [Frostbreaker](../objects/Frostbreaker.md) to the Brutomaker.
- [MadSpark](../pcs/MadSpark.md) starts the first drone, but an issue with setting the explosives on the ice chunk means that drone is lost in space.
- [Olaf](../pcs/Olaf.md) speaks with The Boxer over comms, and they agree to meet and trade a drone from the Brutomaker.
- The Doomborg meets The Boxer and his crew, while they loot the Cold Tomb and move the valuables to the Brutomaker. The crew of the Leadbelly is tied up and gagged, and left in the Leadbelly for the Doomborgs to figure out.
- Then, suddenly, while being playful with the new drone, MadSpark cause an accident and an oxygen leak in the Brutomaker. The two crews start running, but most of The Boxer's crew was further in the aft of the starship, and are lost to space with everything in that part of the ship when it explodes.
- Bennet and MadSpark are safe in the Frostbreaker, while Oni, Olaf and Sabaka - together with TheBoxer and his engineer and the hostages - are safe in the Leadbelly.
