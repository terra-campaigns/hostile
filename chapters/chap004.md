## MadSpark perishes


- [TheBoxer](../npcs/TheBoxer.md) is **pissed off but also afraid**: *Were them send by the [ico](../factions/ico.md)? Are they here to kill us?! Who sent you? Who fucking sent you??!!*
- [TheBoxer](../npcs/TheBoxer.md) mentions he will kill [MadSpark](../pcs/MadSpark.md), but [Olaf](../pcs/Olaf.md) asks him not to take any actions

- The Doomborgs count their numbers, after the explosion of the Brutomaker. It seems [Sabaka](../pcs/Sabaka.md) is missing in action.
- Most of [TheBoxer](../npcs/TheBoxer.md) 's crew has also perished.
- There is a high stakes discussion between [TheBoxer](../npcs/TheBoxer.md) and [Olaf](../pcs/Olaf.md), where the boxer agrees to stay in the Leadbelly while the Doomborgs discuss.
- [Oni](../pcs/Oni.md) communicates with [Oliver Bennet](../pcs/Oliver.md) and [MadSpark](../pcs/MadSpark.md) who are on the [Frostbreaker](../objects/Frostbreaker.md), and agree on a debris-free area to dock both ships.
- [MadSpark](../pcs/MadSpark.md) does a fearsome flyby with the [Frostbreaker](../objects/Frostbreaker.md), scaring Oliver Bennet.
- [Olaf](../pcs/Olaf.md) and [Oni](../pcs/Oni.md) try to convince [MadSpark](../pcs/MadSpark.md) to retire from the crew, after the unfortunate actions of [MadSpark](../pcs/MadSpark.md). They propose tying up the engineer to guarantee everyone's safety.
- Madspark does not agree, and runs and locks himself in the workshop.
- Olaf, afraid of what could happen in the workshop makes a tough decision and commands all crew to go to the bridge, while he flushes the air from the ship.
- [MadSpark](../pcs/MadSpark.md) perishes trying to escape though a ventilation shaft.
- [Oliver](../pcs/Oliver.md) questions the leadership of Olaf: "Sir, I don't think you are leading us for the successful completion of our contract. Now we don't have all required skills in the crew. We need those skills - I could't care less for the human lives lost."

- Considering his remaining options, [TheBoxer](../npcs/TheBoxer.md) sees an opportunity to forge his own death and finally retire in a small farm in Defiance.
- This setup is agreed with everyone, but it requires erasing the proofs of Boxer being alive - which includes killing the hostages from the Leadbelly.
- The Boxer and Oliver coldly push [RanseHardlee](../npcs/RanseHardlee.md), [RandallBellows](../npcs/RandallBellows.md), [JaffaOkoye](../npcs/JaffaOkoye.md) from the airlock.

- The Boxer parks the Leadbelly in a hidden coordinate in the asteroid field.
- The crew takes the Frostbreaker to [BrightsideStation](../locations/BrightsideStation.md). An afraid [YashDutta](../npcs/YashDutta.md) greets them, and allow them to refuel, but not to enter the station.
- [Oni](../pcs/Oni.md) skilfully uninstall the lead panels from the[Frostbreaker](../objects/Frostbreaker.md), so they can land the ship in [Defiance](../locations/Defiance.md) to drop the Boxer.
