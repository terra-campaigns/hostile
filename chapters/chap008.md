## Hitchhiker

> {{ page.timestamp }}, {{ page.sector}}

- The Doomborgs start investigating what could be inside the [Frostbreaker](../objects/Frostbreaker.md). It seems like an invisible alien.
- [Oni](../pcs/Oni.md) quickly checks all possible sensors and decide to go with a thermal sensor to detect friction. It seems that an alien creature is touching all aspects of the starship.
- The group checks their options and decide to turn on the sprinklers, to get a better view of the topology of the alien.

- The crew thinks about their options and decide to set up a trap, moving the metal egg to one of the escape pods. [Olaf](../pcs/Olaf.md) and [Oliver Bennet](../pcs/Oliver.md) execute the plan. Unfortunately the Metaliano does not fall into the trap.
- Further, Oni locks the alien in one of the rooms, but it seems to be able to cut open metal as if it is butter - with come kind of tool that vanishes after being used.
- Oni and Danny investigate the risks of spike driving with the cut in the ship hull, but Oni deems the eletromagnetic field can be used to protect the ship from meta dimensional energies.
- The Frostbreaker spike drives towards [Teegarden's Star](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/system/EK7eZhRuSaUmzSTEwm7a).
- The alien spends all days systematically searching through the starship, touching everything and moving in an seemingly erratic, but systematic and fast, pace. Like an insect.

- On the 6th day the fusion reactor in the ship stops working, due to the wear of the hot fix implemented before. The crew is too afraid to work it out now, and continue the spike drive on reserve power.
- Upon arriving on the Teegarden's Star system, they send an SOS to System Control, and all go outside the capela to repair the reactor.
- In parallel, Olaf and Oni go pick up the metal egg from the escape pod and suddenly bump into an invisible volume. Quickly, Olaf adopts the Furious Toad position, known to protect humans from extra terrestrial hostility.

- As this happens, the metal egg simply vanishes in thin air, and nothing bad happens to Olaf or Oni. Olaf seems to have made the correct choice.
- With the reactor repaired, Olaf decides to speak with [John McLeod](../npcs/JohnMcLeod.md). The manager does not seem interested in helping the crew, and sees an opportunity for them dying and [Tharsis Mining](../factions/tharsisMining.md) not having to pay for the complete mission.
- He does commend the crew on their tactics of bringing a terrorist to Perdurabo.
- After landing in [Defiance](../locations/Defiance.md), Olaf reports the alien to the ICO, and [Eliana Murovec](../npcs/ElianaMurovec.md) pays the crew for her transport.
- The crew is now driven to take down John McLeod. But first, a visit to the low life bar close to the repair docks.
