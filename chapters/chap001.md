# The Frostbreaker

> {{ page.timestamp }}, {{ page.sector}}

The Doomborgs crew's arrival at [Brightside](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/spaceStation/8LCcs3wrwRYwyUx5P0OL) was marked by a tangible tension that clung to the metallic corridors and dimly lit alcoves of the mining station. Brightside, a dilapidated outpost owned by [Haruna](../factions/haruna.md), part of the Matsuyama group, stood as a testament to both human ingenuity and the relentless decay wrought by the hostile environment of space.

As the crew disembarked, they were greeted by a few of the station's weary inhabitants—faces etched with the grime of long hours and the stress of constant vigilance. A space raft ferried them to their own ship, the [Frostbreaker](../objects/Frostbreaker.md), which floated serenely nearby, its exterior promising the safety and stability they craved. The Frostbreaker’s inspection was swift and thorough; everything seemed in order, a rare and welcome relief.

With the ship confirmed to be in working condition, the crew returned to Brightside to finalize their paperwork. The station's inhabitants, a motley mix of engineers, miners, and administrators, eyed them with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. Amidst the routine chaos, the crew struck up a conversation with [Marius Rochambeau](../npcs/MariusRochambeau.md), a scientific representative from [Makita](../factions/makita.md), a subsidiary of the Wu-Ketai group. His demeanor spoke of a man burdened by the monotony and perceived insignificance of his work.

Marius accepted an invitation to the Frostbreaker’s mission launch party, and on their way to the ship, they also extended the invitation to [Roland Lomax](../npcs/RolandLomax.md), another of Brightside’s eclectic residents. The party that ensued aboard the Frostbreaker was a hedonistic escape from their grim reality. Amid the haze of alcohol and recreational drugs, Marius confided his frustrations about his job, while Roland let slip that he possessed damning data implicating [Yash Dutta](../npcs/YashDutta.md), Brightside’s Director, in embezzlement.

Morning came with the weight of a hangover and the gravity of secrets revealed. A virtual meeting with [John McLeod](#johnmcleod), the stern supervisor for Ice Exploration at Tharsis Mining, brought a chilling reprimand. McLeod was displeased, concerned that the crew's indiscretions might have compromised their mission to drill ice in the asteroid. [Olaf](../pcs/Olaf.md), the captain, made a decisive move to divert attention by planning a visit to one of the nearby sky tombs, under the guise of adventurers seeking fortune.

Negotiations with Marius and [Ranse Hardlee](../npcs/RanseHardlee.md) were swift, resulting in the purchase of coordinates to one such tomb, rumored to hold untold riches. The Frostbreaker set a course for the tomb, each member of the crew knowing that the path ahead was fraught with danger and intrigue, yet driven by the promise of discovery and the thrill of the unknown.

> ***MadSpark doesn’t remember much of this, his version of events goes as follows***
> - arrived at a space station after a boring travel but made a neat little BB Gun from my seatbelt
> - got told to put my shotgun in a locker (but luckily kept my hunting knife)
> - found some great spare parts for the little drone I’ve been planning to make 
> - the ship has a basic but adequately equipped workshop, so started work on the drone 
> - everyone wanted to explore the space station & I needed a drink anyway so off we went 
> - then there were some of these guys who had a bug in their asses about something to do with stealing (apparently it’s not allowed here… 🤷🏼‍♂️) but the skipper sorted it out & then we headed to the bar (it’s interesting that the cameras here are ATX18956 model - I haven’t seen those of years, I’ll have to take one apart at some point for nostalgic reasons)
> - I bought drinks all night & did that trick with the exploding gunpowder shots - I don’t remember much after that
> - Oh yeah, we’re going to see if we can find some valuable alien artefacts to make some extra moolah 💰(sounds more interesting than the mission anyway!)
