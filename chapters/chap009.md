## Bad weather in Defiance

- The [Frostbreaker](../objects/Frostbreaker.md) is repaired, but unfortunately the worst weather of decades, with dozens of hurricanes, makes flying off [Defiance](../locations/Defiance.md) too risky.
- The Doomborgs frequent the Broken Thruster bar in the meantime, and meet [Aaros](../pcs/Aaros.md), a doctor who has been stuck in Defiance for years due to bad people management practices from Tharsis. They enter an agreement and Aaros joins the crew.
- As they wanted to hack the AI briefcase, Aaros can already help, and connects with [Ava McKenzie](../npcs/AvamcKenzie.md).
- As Ava does her job on the briefcase (disconnecting microphones, cameras, RF transmitters, etc) she also mentions her husband's work in [Tharsis Mining](../factions/tharsisMining.md) has been stressful recently.
- Ava retrieves and print a copy of the 512-bit training hash from the AI in the briefcase. She also hacks Tharsis system to detect the routing destination of data transferred from the briefcase. The location is [Fomalhaut](../locations/Fomalhaut.md), in the Outer Rim.

- The crew also meets Jackson Vega, who gives them contact of a seller of black market spaceships in The Solomons.
- Olaf and Aaros pay another visit to the [ICO](../factions/ico.md) front desk, and speak with an attendant about Fomalhaut. She explains what is known as public knowledge, including the fact the there is a large failed industrial site in the system, meant to build androids - who were later made forbidden. The site was run by [Transdyne Cybersystems](../factions/TDC.md).
- As they leave the front desk, they see a **Wanted** poster for [The Boxer](../npcs/TheBoxer.md), for assassinating ICO members.
- Before departing, Olaf goes to a boxing rig, and the crew quickly makes thousands in bets.

## In Solomons

- After an uneventful spike drive, the Doomborgs arrive in [The Solomons](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/asteroidBelt/JUkP8shMcIxoqivuOFBp).
- Somewhere they see the news that [Haruna](../factions/haruna.md) is publicly apologising for the accident in [Brightside](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/spaceStation/8LCcs3wrwRYwyUx5P0OL) - not recognising it was a terrorist attack.
- Olaf has been exchanging messages with The Boxer, and they agree to eventually meet in the base known as Suliman.
- Oni leads the group to meet Katrina, his old good friend. They meet in the base called Payback. After being told the entire story of Oni's last year, Katrina shares that a famous researcher, [Nicolaas Argyre](../npcs/Argyre.md) has been trying to purchase [Novium](../objects/Aetherium.md#Novium), which is manufactured in Perdurabo.
- They also speak with a trader about buying starships, including black market options, or on how to get small ships in long haul to the Rim.
- Finally, Oni meets his old mentor, Ethan Wong, who works is the colony's medical officer for Central, from [Matsuyama](../factions/haruna.md). They agree to meet.
