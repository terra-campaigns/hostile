# Poems

You were hired by the [Book of the Sky](../factions/bookSky.md) to recover a microfilm canister from a derelict industrial space station in [Fomalhaut](../locations/Fomalhaut.md).
You will receive tickets to get to the system, and then a shuttle to get close to the space station.
The shuttle will be an illegal one, given the station is currently under a blockade stablished by the [ICO](../factions/ico.md).

The site is a large failed industrial site in the system, meant to build androids - who were later made forbidden.
It was formally run by [Transdyne Cybersystems](../factions/TDC.md).
