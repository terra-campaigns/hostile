## The Cold tomb

- The Doomborgs crew arrive in the Cold Tomb. The structure was built in an ice chunk in one of the asteroids in the Perdurabo system.
- The ship is docked in the entrance of the tomb, and Olaf and Oliver suit up and are ready in the air lock. Through a scan they know that beyond the tomb entrance door the environment is filled with icy water.
- The two crewmen venture inside, with a system of communication and power umbilicals and a 50 meter harness cable. Sabaka stays behind in the airlock ready to rewind the cable if necessary.
- In the entrance room, shaped like a sphere, they record on their cameras alien language carved in the icy wall, and an image depicting a blurred humanoid alien in what seems like a position of power.
- While this was happening, MadSpark feels the need of action, and leaves the ship in a second airlock. While investigating the surroundings of the construction, he detects faint biological matter readings on his suit. He communicates that to Olaf and Oliver, who now turn on their precise detectors too, receiving the same readings.
- The crew hypothesise that the readings are coming from the water (melted from the asteroid ice), and take a sample from inside the tomb. MadSpark gets back on the ship and take the sample to the lab. He starts to feel dizzy.
- In the tomb, Oliver and Olaf reach another room where they find dozens of alien bodies floating in the water. They quickly grab one and, in a haste movement, decide to retreat to the spaceship.
- On their way back, a drone swims in their direction and shoots a shard of metal in their direction, but the crewmen were faster and lock themselves in the airlock before the drone can enter. Oni skillfully undock the Frostbreaker from the tomb and pilot the ship back to Brightside.
- After decontaminating the air, Olaf and Oliver join the crew in the ship again, but now everyone is feeling slightly sick, unfocused and dizzy.
- On the way back, some movement readings withing the starship structure alert Oni. The crew quickly retreat to the citadel and command the ship from there. They soon see in the cameras a dozens crab-like alien creatures exploring she starship. 
- MadSpark flushes the starship atmosphere. At the same time Olaf starts to feel very sick and anxious. He thinks for a brief moment that MadSpark is flushing the citadel and panics. The other crew members calm him down, and they all see the crab creatures passing out.
- Upon arrival in Brightside, Yash Dutta does not allow the immediate off boarding of the crew due to contamination risk, and Olaf decides to speak with John McLeod. John quickly decides that the finding is too high profile, and the Doomborgs are ordered to immediatelly travel back to Earth.
- After a failed attempt to threat Yash, the Frostbreaker departs from Brightside. The destination is the Teegardenâ€™s Star system, where in the main world (Defiance) a remote office of Tharsis and the ICO (Interstellar Commerce Organisation) are available.
