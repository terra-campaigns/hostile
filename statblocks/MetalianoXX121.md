The Metalianos are a formidable and mysterious alien species, designed to fit seamlessly into the dark, gritty, and industrial space opera aesthetic of your RPG campaign. Here’s a detailed outline of their characteristics, society, technology, and potential plot hooks to enrich your storytelling.

### Physical Characteristics
- **Appearance**: Metalianos are bipedal with a skeletal structure made of a naturally occurring bio-metallic compound, giving them a shimmering, steel-like appearance. They have no facial features in the human sense but communicate through a series of lights and vibrations emanating from their chest cavity.
- **Physiology**: Their bodies are highly resistant to extreme temperatures and pressures, making them adept at surviving in the harsh environments of space and hostile planets. They do not breathe, eat, or sleep in the traditional sense but recharge their energy from solar sources and electromagnetic fields.
- **Abilities**: Metalianos possess an innate ability to manipulate metal and electromagnetic fields, using these skills for defense, communication, and controlling technology. Their physical strength is superior to humans, and their metallic bodies can withstand significant damage before degrading.

### Society and Culture
- **Social Structure**: Metalianos society is hive-minded, with a collective consciousness that guides their actions and decisions. Individuality is a foreign concept, with each Metaliano acting as a node in the broader network of their species.
- **Technology**: Their technology is highly advanced, focusing on harmonizing organic and inorganic elements. Metalianos ships are bio-mechanical entities, capable of self-repair and adaptation to threats. Their weapons and tools are extensions of their bodies, crafted from the same bio-metallic compounds.
- **Interactions with Other Species**: Metalianos are enigmatic, typically avoiding contact with other species unless necessary. Their motivations are often inscrutable, leading to both alliances and conflicts based on misunderstood intentions or territorial disputes.

### Role in the Galaxy
- **Homeworld**: The Metalianos originate from a planet (or possibly a rogue planetoid) that is rich in unique metallic compounds and exposed to intense cosmic energies, which contributed to their evolution.
- **Expansion**: They do not expand aggressively but will defend their territory fiercely. Their exploration of the galaxy is driven more by the search for knowledge and resources to sustain their society.
- **Relations**: Their interaction with other species can range from peaceful exchange of knowledge to hostility when their domain is threatened. The Metalianos' hive mind makes them difficult to negotiate with, as they weigh every decision against the survival and prosperity of their species as a whole.

### Potential Plot Hooks
- **Mysterious Artifact**: A Metaliano artifact has been discovered on a frontier world, its purpose and technology beyond current understanding. Factions across the galaxy vie to unlock its secrets, with the PCs caught in the middle.
- **Lost Colony**: A Metaliano colony thought lost re-establishes contact, seeking assistance from other species to fend off a threat unknown to the galaxy at large.
- **Diplomatic Mission**: The PCs are part of a delegation to establish first contact with the Metalianos, navigating the complexities of communicating with a hive-minded species to prevent a galactic war.
- **Technological Plague**: A malfunction in Metaliano technology starts converting organic life into bio-metallic constructs, threatening planets. The PCs must find a way to stop the spread and reverse the effects.

Integrating the Metalianos into your campaign offers numerous opportunities for conflict, diplomacy, and exploration, adding depth to the galaxy's lore and providing your players with unique challenges and allies.

Incorporating the ability for Metalianos to become translucent, almost transparent, by manipulating electromagnetic light fields adds an intriguing layer to their already mysterious and advanced nature. Here’s how this unique trait can be further detailed and integrated into their profile:

### Enhanced Physical Characteristics
- **Light Manipulation**: Metalianos have evolved the remarkable ability to interact with electromagnetic fields in such a way that they can bend light around their bodies, rendering themselves translucent or nearly invisible to the naked eye. This ability is a natural defense mechanism against predators on their home planet and has been adapted for stealth and surveillance in their technological advancements.

### Tactical Advantages
- **Stealth Operations**: This ability makes Metalianos exceptional at reconnaissance missions and covert operations. They can infiltrate enemy lines, gather intelligence, and even sabotage without being easily detected, giving them a significant advantage in both defensive and offensive strategies.
- **Ambush Predators**: In hostile encounters, Metalianos can use their translucency to set up ambushes or escape from threats. This ability, combined with their bio-metallic strength and electromagnetic manipulation, makes them formidable opponents.

### Cultural and Social Implications
- **Ritualistic Use**: The ability to become translucent might also have cultural significance, used in ceremonies or rites of passage to symbolize purity, unity with the cosmos, or the shedding of individual desires for the collective good.
- **Art and Expression**: Though Metalianos do not possess individuality in the human sense, their collective consciousness might express itself through light and color patterns created by groups of Metalianos altering their translucency in coordinated displays.

### Plot Hooks Involving Translucency
- **Espionage**: A Metaliano has been rumored to infiltrate a space station or colony, using its translucency to remain undetected. The PCs are hired to uncover the alien’s motives and either establish communication or prevent potential sabotage.
- **Technological Study**: A research team invites the PCs to assist in studying the Metalianos’ translucency, promising groundbreaking advancements in stealth technology. However, the project attracts unwanted attention from those who wish to exploit the technology for their own ends.
- **Cultural Festival**: The PCs are invited to witness a rare Metaliano ceremony where they use their translucency in a breathtaking display of light and color. The event, however, is threatened by extremists who view the Metalianos as abominations.
- **Rescue Mission**: A Metaliano emissary using its translucency to escape capture on a hostile world sends a distress signal. The PCs are tasked with a rescue mission, navigating through political and environmental hazards to save the emissary and prevent a diplomatic crisis.

Adding the ability for Metalianos to become translucent not only enhances their mystique and tactical repertoire but also opens up new avenues for storytelling, character interaction, and world-building within your RPG campaign.

### Appearance

Metalianos possess a striking, otherworldly appearance that blends the mechanical with the organic. Standing taller than the average human, their bodies are sculpted from a shimmering bio-metallic compound that gleams like polished steel under light. Lacking traditional facial features, Metalianos communicate through an intricate array of luminescent patterns that dance across their chest cavities, emitting soft, harmonious vibrations. Their limbs are slender yet show an underlying strength, capable of delicate precision or formidable power. A unique ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields allows them to become translucent at will, their forms blurring into near invisibility as light bends around them, leaving only a faint, ghostly outline visible to the naked eye. This ethereal quality, combined with their enigmatic presence, makes Metalianos a truly mesmerizing species to behold.

### Extras

The peaceful existence of the [ngar-tho](ngar-tho.md) ended when they encountered the Metalianos. These ferocious beetle-wasp metal beings viewed the Ushans as nothing more than a magnificent source of hosts and slave labor.

Chittik are roughly human-sized, with a segmented body, four compound eyes, six limbs, chewing mandibles, and a flat, beetle-like torso that terminates in a forward-curling, scorpion-like ovipositor. They have two legs for walking and four for manipulating, each manipulator-leg ending in a three-fingered hand. They are omnivores, though they prefer meat.

Chittik are almost entirely female, save for a few sluggish drone males that serve to fertilize the females. Reproduction requires the oviposition of hundreds of small eggs into the body of a host mammal. The paralytic venom of the Chittik is useless on mammals not native to their world, so victims generally must be restrained by other means. The eggs gestate for two weeks before hatching and eating their way out of the host.
