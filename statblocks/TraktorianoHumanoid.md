The Traktorianos present a fascinating concept for an alien race, particularly within the dark, gritty, and horror-filled universe of our RPG campaign. Here is a detailed description of the Traktorianos, reflecting the themes of gritty sci-fi and horror:

### Overview
The Traktorianos are a parasitic alien race, appearing primarily as large, sentient brains capable of advanced thought, communication, and psychic abilities. Unlike traditional organisms, Traktorianos do not have a fixed physical form but instead survive by hopping between hosts. These hosts need to have a biology compatible with human physiology, as the Traktorianos have adapted specifically to utilize such organisms for their survival. The process of host transfer is both a means of reproduction and a way to extend their life indefinitely.

### Biology and Lifecycle
- **Hopping Mechanism:** The Traktorianos' central feature is their ability to hop from one host to another. This process involves a complex biological and psychic ritual where the Traktoriano detaches from its current host and physically integrates itself into a new one. The host's original consciousness is suppressed or completely overwritten, effectively rendering the Traktoriano the new "owner" of the body.
  
- **Host Compatibility:** While they prefer hosts with human-like biology for their longevity and adaptability, Traktorianos are not strictly limited to humans. They can, in desperate circumstances, inhabit other species with similar anatomical structures, though with reduced lifespan and potential psychic abilities.
  
- **Psychic Abilities:** Traktorianos possess inherent psychic abilities, which are amplified or diminished based on the physiological compatibility of their current host. These abilities range from telepathy and mind control to more advanced powers like psychic cloaking or telekinesis, used both for survival and maintaining secrecy.

### Society and Culture
- **Collective Knowledge:** With lifespans stretching indefinitely through host-hopping, Traktorianos possess vast repositories of knowledge and history. They value information above all and see other species primarily as vessels or threats.
  
- **Isolationist by Nature:** Given their parasitic lifestyle, Traktorianos tend to be secretive and isolationist. They interact with other species only when necessary, often manipulating events from the shadows to ensure their survival and protect their interests.
  
- **Host Selection:** Traktorianos are selective about their hosts, preferring individuals in positions of power or influence, which allows them to manipulate societal structures to their advantage subtly.

### Weaknesses and Limitations
- **Dependence on Hosts:** Their need for compatible hosts is a significant vulnerability. A lack of suitable hosts or a disease affecting potential hosts can threaten their survival.
  
- **Psychic Vulnerability:** While powerful, their psychic abilities can be countered by individuals or technologies designed to resist psychic influence, making them vulnerable in certain confrontations.
  
- **Cultural Stagnation:** Their long lifespans and method of survival can lead to a form of cultural stagnation, as old ideas persist and adapt less quickly to new societies or technologies.

### Role in the Campaign
Traktorianos can serve as mysterious manipulators behind the scenes, ancient beings with esoteric knowledge, or desperate survivors seeking new hosts to maintain their immortality. Their existence raises ethical questions about identity, survival, and the cost of eternal life, making them a complex and intriguing addition to any campaign set in the universe.

Incorporating Traktorianos into your RPG campaign can lead to a variety of plot lines, from the horror of discovering a hidden Traktoriano within a community to the intrigue of uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy led by these eternal beings. Their unique lifecycle and psychic powers also offer unique challenges and opportunities for player characters, whether they're facing off against a Traktoriano threat or seeking to ally with one for a greater purpose.

Integrating the capability for Traktorianos to inhabit engineered mechanical hosts adds a fascinating layer to their biology and societal roles, blending the themes of gritty sci-fi and horror with a touch of cyberpunk. Here’s an expanded look into this aspect:

### Adaptation to Mechanical Hosts
- **Mechanical Integration:** Traktorianos, in rare circumstances, can choose to inhabit specially engineered mechanical bodies. These bodies are designed to mimic human biology to an extent, incorporating synthetic tissues and fluids necessary for the Traktoriano's survival. While this is not their preferred method of existence due to the mechanical bodies' limited sensory input and emotional experience, it serves as a crucial survival strategy in environments or situations where organic hosts are scarce or compromised.

- **Technological Symbiosis:** The process of integrating into a mechanical host involves a complex biotechnological procedure where the Traktoriano's brain is encased in a bio-compatible chamber, connecting its neural tissue to the host's artificial systems. This symbiosis allows the Traktoriano to control the mechanical body as if it were organic, though with some inherent limitations in terms of flexibility, sensation, and psychic ability strength.

- **Psychic Abilities and Limitations:** In a mechanical host, a Traktoriano's psychic abilities are augmented by the host's technological enhancements, such as enhanced communication arrays or energy manipulation modules. However, the lack of a fully organic nervous system means that some of their more nuanced psychic powers, particularly those involving empathy or subtle mind control, are diminished or altogether lost.

### Cultural Implications
- **Emergency Measure:** The use of mechanical hosts is generally regarded among Traktorianos as an emergency measure, a testament to their adaptability but also a reminder of their vulnerability. It's a choice made in times of crisis, such as when facing a shortage of compatible organic hosts or when operating in extremely hazardous environments that organic bodies can't withstand.

- **Status and Identity:** Traktorianos inhabiting mechanical hosts might face a complex identity crisis, struggling with the loss of organic sensations and the nuances of psychic abilities. This can lead to a unique subculture among Traktorianos, where those in mechanical bodies seek to redefine their identities and roles within their society.

- **Engineering and Innovation:** The necessity of mechanical hosts has spurred innovation among Traktorianos, leading to advancements in bio-mechanical engineering and artificial intelligence. This drive for technological advancement might even lead to alliances with other species or factions skilled in robotics and cybernetics, creating a web of intrigue and potential conflict within the campaign.

### Role in the Campaign
Traktorianos with the ability to inhabit mechanical hosts open up a range of narrative possibilities, from stories of survival and adaptation in a universe filled with danger to complex plots of technological espionage and bio-mechanical warfare. Players might encounter a Traktoriano desperately seeking to transfer to an organic host to regain lost abilities, or they might ally with one utilizing a mechanical body to survive in a hostile, technology-dominated environment.

This unique aspect of the Traktorianos not only emphasizes the themes of eternal life and adaptability but also introduces questions about the essence of consciousness and the boundaries between organic life and artificial existence. It enriches the campaign world with depth, complexity, and the potential for thrilling adventures.

### Appearance

In their most vulnerable form, a Traktoriano appears as a grotesque and pulsating brain, veins and neural fibers visibly throbbing with bio-luminescent energy. This core of their being, about the size of a large melon, is encased in a protective, semi-transparent sac that pulsates with each psychic pulse, revealing the complex neural pathways and the eerie glow of their life force within. The surface of the brain is slick, with a texture that seems to constantly shift and ripple, as if reacting to the thoughts and stimuli that course through its form.

When inhabiting an organic host, the Traktoriano is invisible, perfectly concealed within the body of its chosen vessel. The only hint of their presence might be a subtle change in the host's eye color, a sudden flash of bio-luminescent green or blue that mirrors the Traktoriano's natural glow, noticeable only during moments of intense psychic exertion or emotional turmoil.

In the case of a mechanical host, the Traktoriano's brain is often housed within a central chamber, visible through a clear, durable material designed to mimic the aesthetic of its organic casing. The mechanical body itself is a marvel of bio-mechanical engineering, blending human-like articulation with the cold precision of machinery. These hosts can range from eerily lifelike, with synthetic skin and features that almost perfectly mimic human appearance, to more utilitarian forms where the mechanical nature is unabashedly displayed, highlighting the fusion of technology and alien intellect. Here, the Traktoriano's presence is marked by the occasional flicker of its neural sac's glow through parts of the mechanical body, serving as a haunting reminder of the alien intelligence that resides within.

Regardless of the host, a Traktoriano carries an aura of otherworldly knowledge and an unsettling grace, moving with a deliberateness that belies their alien nature. Their true form, a brain capable of endless existence through host-hopping, remains a chilling testament to their adaptability and the profound alien horror they represent in the universe.

### Extras

The peaceful existence of the [ngar-tho](ngar-tho.md) ended when they encountered the Metalianos. These ferocious beetle-wasp metal beings viewed the Ushans as nothing more than a magnificent source of hosts and slave labor.

Chittik are roughly human-sized, with a segmented body, four compound eyes, six limbs, chewing mandibles, and a flat, beetle-like torso that terminates in a forward-curling, scorpion-like ovipositor. They have two legs for walking and four for manipulating, each manipulator-leg ending in a three-fingered hand. They are omnivores, though they prefer meat.

Chittik are almost entirely female, save for a few sluggish drone males that serve to fertilize the females. Reproduction requires the oviposition of hundreds of small eggs into the body of a host mammal. The paralytic venom of the Chittik is useless on mammals not native to their world, so victims generally must be restrained by other means. The eggs gestate for two weeks before hatching and eating their way out of the host.
