- MadSpark is a roughneck explosive expert that studied in LA who can also fly spacecraft / drones (co-pilot in this crew?).
- He was a hardworking & intelligent student at Uni & then went to work on several mining missions. During one of these missions, he was involved in an accident where the explosives went off too early (he liked the adrenaline rush of running away & feeling the heat of the explosion on his back but this time he misjudged it…) & got hit on the head by a flying rock. After much surgery & time in hospital, he survived but since then he has had a screw loose.
- He’s obviously in mining industry work for the money but also just because he loves to “blow shit up” & gets a hard on making things explode!
- He is a practical engineer who is constantly making new gadgets. If you ask him to make something & he has the right materials / tools, he can make anything. If he’s not asked to make something useful, he will spend his time making pointless gadgets that amuse him. He has invented his own type of shotgun that can be used in space (it mixes oxygen & nitrogen in the right quantities to provide quite a kick!). 
- He finds it difficult to communicate with people & is definitely “on the spectrum”!
- Appearance: tall, lean but strong & redneck in appearance. Around 30 years old but looks older. He has no eyebrows (they keep getting burnt off in explosions!).
