Olaf Gustafson, born in Iceland in the year 2146 (79 yo). He is an old (but athletic) failed geologist who became a geography teacher for teenagers. He spends most of his time looking for proofs that intelligent aliens exist and they are good to us. He is sure they are the ones responsible for establishing the mega corporations and we have only to thank them for improving our world. As a kid he was (or thinks he was) abducted by Greys. And that they implanted something on him that healed him from asthma. He believes the aliens spared him for a reason. And that reason is to help the mega corporations thrive. For decades he religiously went to the gym and trained boxing. He used to be wiser, though. But now he has developed stage one Alzheimer and sometimes forgets important things, or act a bit silly or childish. During his geology studies he interned in the mega corp X where he helped them mine asteroid Y. He learned the hard work of the miners and also a bit of the managing part. After finishing his studies he continued working for corp X for 10 years as a miner. Besides the conspiracy of intelligent aliens existing, he also thinks that there exists a Galactic Confederation where aliens and humans decide the fate of the different planets.
