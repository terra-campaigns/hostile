![Oni Ro](../../_published/hostile/context.md#Oni%20Ro)

Personality traits: Skillful and helpful. Comfortable making technical decisions, but does not like being responsible for others. That's why he would never aspire to be a team leader or captain. He'd rather be part of a team and do his tasks, maybe socialize a bit, too; but the rest of the time, you'll see him relaxing in his room or common area playing games. Sometimes even when he drives - don't worry, it's mainly when on auto-pilot. :)..  
  
Oni has worked in his family bussiness for some years, as desired by his parents and older siblings. However, Oni didn't like the lifestyle of running a bussiness, neither the fast pace and stress. He studied engineering and learned a lot during his internships in very successful companies like X,Y. Mostly, he loved propulsion systems and designing; he sure was creative. To leave from his family business though would be challenging. He had to leave Earth. He worked until he got enough credits to salvage and buy material to make his own small ship. With some help and luck, he made the ship that would take him to {somewhere in the universe}, where he had a friend, Era (from gaming). She was also a technician and they were close. She urged him to start his own business as a contractor and so he did. He started from working in .... and then his reach went further and further.  
  
After some years of working in a variety of technical projects he had gotten comfortable. But something was missing, ........ he decided to try out bounty hunting and took some missions in between projects. He had gotten good with piloting his ship so in the beginning he was doing good. In his 4th mission, when chasing a renowed criminal in the area, he almost died trying to catch him. That made him reflect on what he's doing with his time in this life, and after talking to his good friend Era he decided to contribute in different ways to humanity. (Era sort of told him off. he was telling: the big corporations don't care about X, Y, and they only care for profit, but she explained there are also no workers that would do this, like you; you prefer the more rewarding job than the helpful one, if you really cared you would go;)
